## What We Built

We built a comprehensive AI-powered DevOps portal that serves as a bridge between human operators and autonomous AI agents for DevOps operations. The platform features:

### Core Features
- **AI-Powered Operations**: ChatGPT-integrated assistant that can execute DevOps operations through natural language commands
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**: Standardized interface for AI agents to interact with DevOps tools and systems
- **Enterprise Security**: Descope-based authentication with role-based access controls
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live dashboards for logs, metrics, deployments, and rollbacks
- **Autonomous Deployments**: AI agents can deploy services and perform rollbacks based on system conditions
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Centralized logging system with filtering and real-time updates

### Key Components
- **Dashboard Interface**: Modern React-based UI with tabbed navigation
- **MCP Service Layer**: Handles communication with backend MCP server
- **Authentication System**: Secure user management with session handling
- **AI Assistant**: Natural language interface for DevOps operations
- **Monitoring Tools**: Real-time system health and performance tracking

## How to Run It

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Descope account and project setup
- OpenAI API key
- MCP server running (backend)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   Create `.env.local` file with the following variables:
   ```bash
   # Descope Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=your_descope_project_id_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCOPE_BASE_URL=https://api.descope.com
   
   # MCP Server Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8001
   
   # OpenAI Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   
   # Next.js Configuration
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access Application**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Production Deployment

1. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Redeploy** after adding environment variables
